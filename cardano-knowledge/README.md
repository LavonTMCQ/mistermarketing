## 🎯 **Our Specific Use Case**

### **What We're Building:**
A smart contract system that allows Discord users to pay with ADA for premium bot features.

### **Core Requirements:**
1. **Payment Validation** - Verify user paid correct ADA amount
2. **Subscription Management** - Handle monthly/yearly subscriptions  
3. **User Identification** - Link Discord user ID to payment
4. **Automatic Access** - Grant Discord roles/permissions after payment
5. **Multiple Tiers** - Support Premium (5 ADA) and Ultra (10 ADA) tiers

### **Technical Components:**
1. **Smart Contract** (Aiken) - Validates payments and manages subscriptions
2. **Off-Chain Code** (Node.js) - Monitors blockchain and updates Discord
3. **Discord Bot Integration** - Handles user commands and role management
4. **Payment UI** - Generates payment addresses and instructions

## 📚 **How to Use This Knowledge Store**

### **For Learning (Weeks 1-2):**
1. Start with `01-fundamentals/` - Learn Cardano and Aiken basics
2. Read `02-payment-contracts/` - Understand payment validation
3. Study `04-implementation/contract-templates/` - See real examples

### **For Building (Weeks 3-4):**
1. Use `04-implementation/` templates as starting point
2. Reference `03-discord-integration/` for off-chain code
3. Follow `04-implementation/deployment-guide.md` for deployment

### **For Security (Week 4+):**
1. Review `05-security/security-checklist.md` before deployment
2. Check `05-security/common-vulnerabilities.md` for issues to avoid
3. Follow `05-security/audit-process.md` for final review

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Phase 1: Setup (Day 1)**
1. Read `06-tools-and-apis/development-setup.md`
2. Install Aiken and required tools
3. Try examples in `01-fundamentals/aiken-syntax.md`

### **Phase 2: Learn (Days 2-7)**
1. Work through `01-fundamentals/` folder
2. Study `02-payment-contracts/` examples
3. Practice with `04-implementation/testing-examples/`

### **Phase 3: Build (Days 8-21)**
1. Start with `04-implementation/contract-templates/`
2. Implement Discord integration from `03-discord-integration/`
3. Test everything thoroughly

### **Phase 4: Deploy (Days 22-28)**
1. Follow `04-implementation/deployment-guide.md`
2. Complete `05-security/security-checklist.md`
3. Launch on mainnet!
